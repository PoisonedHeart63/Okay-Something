The thingy for class
members: Alanna and Carl Stocker
This set of code prompts the user for their name
After they enter their name then they are asked to type in the number 1
If they do not type in the number 1 then they are prompted to do it again
if they do type in 1
then they get a congratulatory message with their name included.
super- simplistic!
